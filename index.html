        <h1> Our Mission </h1>

        <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. 
            Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! 
            As one or our members told us:

            Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.</p>
